# Machine Learning Name Finder

This extension allows you to easily find your name in the autograder matrix.  I found it very frustrating to trace the lines across the page, so I created this extension to do so.

-----------------------

There are two options to use the extension:

### Pack the extension yourself from the sourcecode.

Feel free to fork this repository and edit the code to suit your needs.  I did this rather quickly and will be editing it if I find any bugs.

You can find tons of resources for chrome extensions here: [http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)


### Install the already packed extension I have provided.

There is a file called wustlcse517extension.crx in the repo.  You can drag this file directly to chrome to install it.  

Open up [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and drag the file there to install.

#### Instructions for use

*   Click the extension icon

*	Type in your name (case matters)

*	Submit the form and your row will be highlighted in white

Note:  Due to the random refreshes of the page you will currently have to reinput your name each time it refreshes.

#### Let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas

*   Feel free to submit a bug report, I will try and work on it when I have time.
